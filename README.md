# learningOrchestra

## Introduction

### Context

Nowadays, **data science relies on a wide range of computer science skills**, from data management to algorithm design, from code optimization to cloud infrastructures. Data scientists are expected to have expertise in these diverse fields, especially when working in small teams or for academia.

This situation can constitute a barrier to the actual extraction of new knowledge from collected data, which is why the last two decades have seen more efforts to facilitate and streamline the development of data mining workflows. The tools created can be sorted into two categories: **high-level** tools facilitate the building of **automatic data processing pipelines** (e.g. :question:) while **low-level** ones support the setup of appropriate physical and virtual infrastructure (e.g. :question:).

However, this landscape is still missing a tool that **encompasses all steps and needs of a typical data science project**. This is where learningOrchestra comes in.

### The learningOrchestra system

learningOrchestra aims to facilitate the development of complex data mining workflows by **seamlessly interfacing different data science tools and services**. From a single interoperable Application Programming Interface (API), users can **design their analytical pipelines and deploy them in an environment with the appropriate capabilities**.

learningOrchestra is designed for data scientists from both engineering and academia backgrounds, so that they can **focus on the discovery of new knowledge** in their data rather than library or maintenance issues.

## Quick-start

Installation instructions:
1. learningOrchestra runs on Linux hosts. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on all instances of your cluster. Configure your cluster in [swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/). Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your manager instance.
2. Clone repo on your manager instance. `https://github.com/learningOrchestra/learningOrchestra.git`
3. `cd learningOrchestra`
4. Deploy with `sudo ./run.sh`

learningOrchestra provides two options to access its features: a microservice REST API and a Python package.

Microservice REST API: We recommand using a GUI REST API caller like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). Check the [list of available microservices](https://learningorchestra.github.io/learningOrchestra-docs/usage/#microservices-rest-apis) for requests details.

Python package:
- Python 3 package
- Install with `pip install learning-orchestra-client`
- Start your scripts by import the package and providing the IP address of one of the instances of your cluster:
```
from learning_orchestra_client import *
cluster_ip = "xx.xx.xxx.xxx"
Context(cluster_ip)
```
- Each microservice is wrapped into a class. Check the [package documentation](https://learningorchestra.github.io/learningOrchestra-docs/python-apis/) for a list of available functions and parameters.

## How do I install learningOrchestra?

:bell: This documentation assumes that the users are familiar with a number of advanced computer science concepts. We have tried to link to learning resources to support beginners, as well as introduce some of the concepts in the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions). But if something is still not clear, don't hesitate to [ask for help](#on-using-learningOrchestra).

### Setting up your cluster

learningOrchestra operates from a [cluster](#what-is-a-cluster?) of Docker [containers](#what-is-a-container?).

All your hosts must operate under Linux distributions and have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

Configure your cluster in [swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/). Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your manager instance.

You are ready to deploy! :tada:

### Deploy learningOrchestra

Clone this repository on your manager instance.
- Using HTTP protocol, `git clone https://github.com/learningOrchestra/learningOrchestra.git`
- Using SSH protocol, `git clone git@github.com:learningOrchestra/learningOrchestra.git`
- Using GitHub CLI, `gh repo clone learningOrchestra/learningOrchestra`

Move to the root of the directory, `cd learningOrchestra`.

Deploy with `sudo ./run.sh`. The deploy process should take a dozen minutes.

##### Interrupt learningOrchestra

Run `docker stack rm microservice`.

## How do I use learningOrchestra?

learningOrchestra is organised into interoperable [microservices](#what-are-microservices?). They offer access to third-party libraries, frameworks and software to **gather data**, **clean data**, **train machine learning models**, **evaluate machine learning models** and **visualize data and results**.

The following microservices are available in the current version:
- Database API- Gather data
- Projection API- Visualize data and results (I'm assuming we're talking about mapping data points into display points?)
- Data type API- Clean data
- Histogram API- Visualize data and results
- t-SNE API- Train machine learning models + Visualize data and results
- PCA API- Train machine learning models + Visualize data and results
- Model builder API- Train machine learning models

learningOrchestra provides two options to access its features: a microservice REST API and a Python package.

### Using the microservices REST API

We recommand using a **GUI REST API** caller like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). Of course, regular `curl` commands from the terminal remain a possibility.

The details for each microservice are available in the [documentation](https://learningorchestra.github.io/learningOrchestra-docs/usage/#microservices-rest-apis).

### Using the Python package

**learning-orchestra-client** is a Python 3 package available through the Python Package Index. Install it with `pip install learning-orchestra-client`.

All your scripts must import the package and create a link to the cluster by providing the IP address to an instance of your cluster. Preface your scripts with the following code:
```
from learning_orchestra_client import *
cluster_ip = "xx.xx.xxx.xxx"
Context(cluster_ip)
```

Check the [package documentation](https://learningorchestra.github.io/learningOrchestra-docs/python-apis/) for a list of available functions and parameters, or the [package repository](https://github.com/learningOrchestra/learningOrchestra-python-client) for an example use case.

### Check cluster status

To check the deployed microservices and machines of your cluster, run `CLUSTER_IP:80` where *CLUSTER_IP* is replaced by the external IP of a machine in your cluster.

The same can be done to check Spark cluster state with `CLUSTER_IP:8080`.
